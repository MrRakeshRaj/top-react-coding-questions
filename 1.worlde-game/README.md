# Wordle Game

In Wordle, there is a secret five-letter word. The player has six tries and must guess different five-letter words to see how close they are to the secret word.

After the player submits a guess, Wordle uses colors to tell the player how close they are to the secret word. If a letter has the color yellow, it means that the letter is in the secret word, but in the wrong position.

The green color tells the user that the letter is in the secret word and in the right position, while the grey color tells the player that the letter is not in the word.
